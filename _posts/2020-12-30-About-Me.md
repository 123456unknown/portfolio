Currently developing novel solutions for complex real-world robotic manipulation problems.

Tasks include:

..* Collect, clean and validate real-world sensor data.

..* Develop mathematical models of complex systems.

..* Design and train machine/deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) to predict such things as robot manipulation forces on deformable objects, and reinforcement learning agents that learn to control robots.

..* Design and implement sensor networking infrastructure using the Robot Operating System (ROS).

..* Design and execution of experiments.

**Research Engineering Technician**<br>
Loughborough University
Sep 2013 – Oct 2017
..* Developed mechanical, electrical and software systems for data acquisition and control of experiments within the Engines and Powertrains Research Facility.
..* Developed algorithms for autonomous engine control.
..* Responsible for the collection, analysis and reporting of experimental results data.
..* Assist and teach PhD students practical engineering skills. (welding, machining)

**Senior Engineer progressing to Engineering Manager**<br>
Linde
Feb 2010 – Sep 2013
United Kingdom
..* Engineering Manager - responsible for the maintenance of all electromechanical/mechatronics systems, liaison between different engineering/management groups, auditing and recording systems data and KPIs, produce reports.

..* Developed software systems using MS excel and MS access - to better facilitate the collection, reporting and querying of systems data.
..* Used data to identify the root causes of high expenditure as well as opportunities for company growth.
..* Developed machine learning/predictive models to forecast potential system failures and optimise maintenance schedules.
